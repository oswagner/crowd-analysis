Cultural Crowds Dataset keeps video clips from different countries, where each root directory contains video sequences from a specific country.
It was organized this way to allow us to investigate cultural aspects.

Each video directory (inside a country directory) keeps the following files:

INPUT FILES:

* Frames
Contains all frames of the video sequence in image format .JPG (000000.jpg).

* Paths_N.txt
Contains all trajectories for the people from that video, in IMAGE coordinates.

* Paths_D.txt
Contains all trajectories for the people from that video, in WORLD coordinates.

* imageList.txt
Contains a simple list of all the names of frames to be processed for that video.


OUTPUT FILES:

* GROUPS_DATA.txt
Contains data about each group found by our method, such as: id of people, distances between agents, speed, angular variation, area, collectivity, disturbance and cohesion.

* GROUPS_INFO.txt
Contains data about people across frames. The values are:
Frame_number amount_of_people amount_of_people_alone amount_of_people_grouped number_of_groups average_of_people_by_group
